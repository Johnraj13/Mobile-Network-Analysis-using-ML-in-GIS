Project Description
The project aims to analyze mobile network data to identify patterns, coverage gaps, and performance issues. By integrating ML classification techniques with GIS, we can visualize and interpret the spatial distribution of network quality and other relevant metrics. This analysis can assist telecom operators in optimizing network performance and planning infrastructure improvements.

Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess mobile network data for analysis.
Classification Models: Implement ML classification models to categorize network performance and coverage.
GIS Integration: Use GIS tools to visualize the spatial distribution of network metrics.
Interactive Maps: Create interactive maps to explore network data geographically.
Reports and Insights: Generate reports with actionable insights for network optimization.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
GIS Tools: QGIS, GeoPandas, Folium
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Other Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
